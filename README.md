# 👋 Hey there, I'm Philip Edward — Pellumi

I'm a passionate Full Stack Engineer with a flair for **frontend and mobile development**, deep curiosity in **AI integration**, and a grounded love for building **systems that matter**. From academic tools to real-time chat systems, every line of code I write is bent toward usability, clarity, and purposeful design.

🧠 I believe technology should empower — not overwhelm. Whether it's a student ordering groceries on campus or a teacher grading AI-assisted tests, I strive to build seamless bridges between user need and system logic.
